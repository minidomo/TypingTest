# TypingTest
This is a typing test GUI I made based on the website [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/) and utilizes an MVC design pattern in attempt to understand design patterns. Easy and Hard words used in the typing test originate from [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/)' Top 200 Words and Top 1000 Words typing tests respectively.

This was for my GUI lab in my Computer Science III Honors class in the 2019 - 2020 school year.
